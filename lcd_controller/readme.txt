There will be two problems that you will encounter during this lab session.
First is printing Turkish characters on LCD. If the serial monitor works for non ASCII
characters, then try to print them on LCD itself and explain how did you manage to do it
on your video. If you were not able to print Turkish characters, explain what methods
have you tried to accomplish this on your video, even though you were not successful.
Second is for text shorter than 16 characters. While printing on LCD screen, you should
assume it as a text that is 16 characters long and filled with space characters (“ ”). That
may make it easier for you to perform scrolling operation.
