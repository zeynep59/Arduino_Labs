In this lab you are asked to create a motor controller using 2 push down buttons, one
seven segment display, direct current motor and L293D motor controller. You will use the
buttons to change the direction and speed of motor.
The left and right button will be used to change the direction of the motor in that
direction (right button for clockwise and left button for counter clockwise rotation). The
seven segment display will be used to show the current speed of motor. You can
arbitrarily divide the speed of motor to 4, 5 or more sections (e.g. 0 is 0% speed, 1 is 25%
speed, 2 is 50% speed, 3 is 75% and 4 is %100 speed, the top speed of motor).
