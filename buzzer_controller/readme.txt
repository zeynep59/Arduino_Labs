In this lab session, you are required to create a buzzer controller to simulate a door bell
using Arduino and other circuit elements. This controller will be managed by global
variables and a push down button. The global variables are given below.Your circuit should work like the following, when the push down button is pressed, the
melody given above should be played for a single time (simulating a door bell button and
music that is played by door bell).
If your buzzer is not able to simulate different musical notes, please explain in your video
what kind of problem you have encountered and which ways you tried to solve it before
giving up.
